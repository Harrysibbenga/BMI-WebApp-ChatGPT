# BMI Calculator Web App

This is a simple web app built with Flask that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight inputs.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official website here.

You'll also need to install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file. To do so, navigate to the project directory and run:

Copy code
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running the following command:

Copy code
```
python app.py
```
This will start the Flask development server and the app should be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5000/.

Usage
To use the app, simply enter your height (in cm) and weight (in kg) in the input fields and click the "Calculate" button. The app will display your BMI value and a message indicating whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

The result container will fade out after 5 seconds. If you want to calculate another BMI, simply enter new values and click the "Calculate" button again.
